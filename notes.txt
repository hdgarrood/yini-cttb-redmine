talk about:
    Redmine
    work result in productivity gains

----------

allow migration to Redmine
	move data
	setup + configuration
	extension to better suit our needs

----------

needs a DB with details of bugs because:
    bugs should never be forgotten about
    versions
        decide which bugs + enhancements per version
        view after release gone out
        therefore essential to keep track of this in DB
    support
        if already reported:
            better answer
            less time
    manage
        answer questions:
            reasonable date next release?	
            divide time between bugs/enhcancements well?

----------

many advantages
    integration
        apache svn
            keep track of all changes to src
                enter them into repository
                get each other's changes
            important because:
                view history -- changes: when, who, why
            integration
                issue page, list of commits per issue

        Jenkins
            building: source files to executables
            keeps track of this:
                each build
                succeeded?
            on issue page:
                see which build each change went into
                - good for testers
    searching
        used to be difficult
            - duplicate bug reports
        can now extract info
            - eg: prioritised todo lists on the fly
                - no longer need to do manually
    notifications
    release notes
        what are they?
        used to be in a plaintext file
        better in DB
            for an upcoming release:
                how many are done?
                generate on-the-fly
                    - this means no manual checking
        I wrote it
        greatly decreased time taken to get releases out

----------

summary
